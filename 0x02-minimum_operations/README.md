### sol

The solution approach was chosen based on the specific constraints and nature of the problem: minimizing the number of operations to reach exactly n characters using only "Copy All" and "Paste" operations. Here's the reasoning behind the method:

Problem Nature: Initial Setup: You start with a single "H". Operations Available: Copy All: Copies the entire content of the file. Paste: Pastes the copied content. Key Insight: The number of "H" characters can only be multiplied by pasting what has been copied. This suggests that the problem has a multiplicative nature.

Optimal Approach: To minimize the number of operations, you should maximize the number of characters added at each step. This means that instead of pasting one "H" at a time, you should try to paste as many as possible each time. Prime Factorization: The best way to approach this problem is by breaking down the target number n into its prime factors. Each prime factor represents a set of operations: Copy All at a point where the number of characters is a factor. Paste multiple times to multiply the characters. Why Prime Factorization? Efficiency: By breaking n down into its prime factors, you ensure that you're performing the fewest possible number of operations to reach n. Each factor represents a step where you can multiply the current number of characters by repeatedly pasting. Example with Multiplicative Factors: If n is 18, which is 2 * 3 * 3, you first aim to double the characters, then triple them, which minimizes the total number of operations. Why This Method Over Others? Direct and Simple: This method directly ties into how multiplication (copy-paste) operations work, making it intuitive and straightforward. Optimal: It guarantees that you're performing the minimum number of operations because you're leveraging the structure of prime factors, which inherently minimizes steps. Scalability: This method can efficiently handle any n, including large numbers, by breaking them down into manageable steps.
